                                The island is roughly 30 kilometers (19 miles) southeast of India's southern coast.Sri Lanka is made up of a large island and several smaller islands.Ceylon was the country's name until 1972.
                                
                                The islands cover 65,610 km2, which is almost 1.5 times the size of Denmark or slightly larger than the state of West Virginia in the United States.
                                
                                Sri Lanka's population was 21.2 million in 2016, and the capital is Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, a satellite city of Colombo, the country's largest city. 
                                Spoken languages are Sinhala (official and national language) 74%, Tamil (a national language) 18%, other 8%, about 10 % of the population speak English as a second language.

                                A sacred pilgrimage site for 22 centuries, this cave monastery, with its five sanctuaries, 
                                is the largest, best-preserved cave-temple complex in Sri Lanka. The Buddhist mural paintings 
                                (covering an area of 2,100 m2 ) are of particular importance, as are the 157 statues.<br><br>
                                Located in central Sri Lanka, the Rangiri Dambulla Cave Temple is a living Buddhist site that is focused on a series of five cave shrines. 
                                Inhabited by forest-dwelling Buddhist monks since the 3rd century BCE, these natural caves have been transformed continuously throughout 
                                the historical period into one of the largest and most outstanding Buddhist complexes in the Southern and South Eastern Asian region, 
                                showcasing innovative approaches to interior layout and decoration. In keeping with a longstanding tradition associated with living 
                                Buddhist ritual practices and continuous royal patronage, the cave shrines underwent several renovation and refurbishing programmes 
                                before assuming their present interior forms in the 18th century. The vast internal spaces of the cave shrines are not compartmentalized, 
                                but are spatially differentiated by a deliberate and subtle arrangement of polychrome sculpture of exceptional craftsmanship and decorated 
                                with brilliant compositions of mural paintings. This spatial hierarchy and purposive interior layout devoid of physical divisions lead the 
                                devotees systematically through the spaces from one ritual function to the next. The site is remarkable in the Buddhist world for its association 
                                with the continuous tradition of living Buddhist ritual practices and pilgrimage for more than two millennia.

                                the jungle from all sides). A series of galleries and staircases emerging from the mouth of a

                                However, the king was defeated in 495, and the palace fell into ruin. The site soon became a pilgrimage destination.
