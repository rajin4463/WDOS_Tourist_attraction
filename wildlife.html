            <h3 align="center"><u>Yala National Park</u></h3><br>
            <p id="wp">
                The second largest and most visited national park in Sri Lanka, Yala is situated in the southeast part of the island and is a vast expanse of dusty woodland and grasslands punctuated by towering boulders. The park is home to some 44 species of mammals and 215 species of birds though its popularity with visitors is due largely to the fact that the park has one of the highest concentrations of leopard in the world and around 350 resident Asian elephants. Also present are sloth bears, golden palm civets, Sri Lankan krait and crocodiles. The coastline around the park is visited by leatherback and loggerhead sea turtles. <br><br>
                Yala National Park has a variety of ecosystems including moist monsoon forests, dry monsoon forests, semi deciduous forests, thorn forests, grasslands, fresh water and marine wetlands, and sandy beaches. One region of the park even has wild rice growing during the rainy season when it floods. The majority of the park is designated a Strict Natural Reserve with no access available to visitors but the small section that is open provides a rewarding safari experience. <br><br>
                Demon King Ravana established his kingdom here with Ravana Kotte, now submerged in the sea, as its boundary. Seafaring traders brought Indo-Aryan civilisation with them and a large number of tanks are the evidence of a rich hydraulic and agricultural civilisation dating back to 5th century BC. Situlpahuwa, which was the home for 12,000 arahants, is situated within the park area along with Magul Vihara, which built in 87 BC and Akasa Chaitiya, which constructed in 2nd century BC. Agriculture flourished in the area in previous times.

        <h3 align="center"><u>Udawalawe National Park</u></h3><br>
        <div>
            <p id="wp">
                The third most visited National Park on the island, Udawalawe has a myriad of interesting flora and fauna helped by the presence of the Udawalawe reservoir on the Walawe river, the surrounding marshes, forests and grasslands. The park's most famous residents are 400 or so elephants. During a visit, it is not unusual to see whole herds of adults and young elephants. Macaques and monkeys remain in uncleared jungle in the park’s northern section whilst water buffalo and various species of deer tend to frequent the southern part. <br><br>
                The waterways are home to crocodiles, a myriad of butterflies, and many birds including an endemic Sri Lankan subspecies of jungle fowl. The habitat surrounding the reservoir includes marshes, the Walawe river and its tributaries, forests and grasslands Green algae and blue green algae grow in the reservoir. As the area was formerly a farming region, there is plenty of open grassland which makes spotting elephants easy. There is also a plantation of teak beyond the southern boundary, below the dam, which was planted before the declaration of the park. <br><br>
                Embilipitiya is a small village that is rapidly becoming a commercial hub thanks to its convenient location next to the famous Udawalawe National Park. With numerous accommodation options and a well-made traveller infrastructure, this village provides a fantastic base for those seeking to venture into the leafy confines of the nearby reserve. At a distance of 158km from Colombo, Embilipitiya is easy to access and has its own unique charm.

        <div>
            <p id="wp">
                Set over 2,000 metres above sea level, the Horton Plains feel a world apart from the rest of Sri Lanka. Large areas of the park are covered in pristine cloud forest, with dramatically plunging cliffs at its southern boundary. Home to a variety of endemic species, it’s one of the best places for bird watching.
